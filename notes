public/ vs assets/

By using public/ the content like images for example are uplifted and we can directly use them without providing absolute path.
The "public" directory is often used to store files that are meant to be directly accessible to the public or end-users.
Files in the "public" directory are accessible through the browser using their relative paths.


In some contexts, "assets" might refer to a directory where developers organize various static files, including images, stylesheets, fonts, and more.
